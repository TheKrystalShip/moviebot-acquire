# Changelog

## 0.4.0

Torrents carry tags, so a surface that announces a finished download can keep its note on the
torrent rather than in its own memory, and survive a restart mid-download.

## 0.3.0

Downloading: the torrent client over its Web API, the acquisition path from a chosen release to a
started download, and `get` and `downloads` on the CLI.

Torrents are added with sequential order and first-and-last-piece priority, so a partial file is
watchable from the beginning rather than only once it finishes.

## 0.2.0

Autocomplete suggestions for a slash command: a debounced, keystroke-safe layer over the search,
and labels built to fit a chat surface's length limit.

The pacing floor between tracker calls drops to half a second. It is charged to whoever is queued
behind a call, and above the autocomplete deadline it answers a second person searching with
nothing every time.

## 0.1.0

Tracker search: the member API client, release-name parsing, the selection policy and the
ranker, the disk budget, and the `moviebot-acquire` CLI over them.

The tracker's member API replaces the scraping this would otherwise need, so there is no login
or HTML parsing anywhere in the project.
